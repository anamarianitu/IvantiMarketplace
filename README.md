# Ivant Marketplace Web APP
Web App marketplace made in semester 3 of the Software Enginnering specialisation at Fontys ICT. Project owner: Ivanti </br>

# Intro

Web App developed with Angular(frontend), Java Spring Boot(backend) and MongoDB(database).

## Description

The idea behind Ivanti Marketplace web app is that it is an online file and package marketplace where users can download as well as post their own packages for free or for a certain price.

1. What is it about?
 - The web app is made so that Ivanti's customers and regular web app users can get certain packages included for free as an addition to the package/product/service Ivanti they are buying
 - This extra features they would be getting are located on the Ivanti Marketplace and are developed by a 3rd party. The 3rd party can post the packages for free or for a price.
 - While certain packages are usually only available for a price, Ivanti would increase the chances of customers buying their own products while including those same 3rd party packages for free
2. Why Angular and Spring Boot?
 - For frontend our team was requested to develop the web app in Angular so when we hand over the finished project to our project owner, the development team at Ivanti can look at our code and integrate certain parts in future projects they have without big issues since the products developed at Ivanti are using Angular
 - The same reason went behind using Spring Boot, the project owner requested it
 - The combination between Angular for frontend and Spring Boot for backend is one of the most popular ones and as those being new frameworks to all the team members we managed to improve fast with the good documentation and large community
3. Challenges faced?
 - One of the challenges we faced was accomodating the project owners needs, even though he gave us freedom to explore and be creative we still had to follow certain guidelines and do things differently than what we had imagined. The team didn't consider this a bad thing but it was challenging to get a simillar vision of the project with no examples of how it should be done
